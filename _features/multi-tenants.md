Need a multi-tenant feature where I can create client accounts, generate landing pages, and allow clients to connect their domains to their hosted pages.

Architecture Overview

Here’s a high-level architecture of the components needed to implement your client management and domain connection feature.
1.	Frontend
	•	Admin Panel: A section where you can create and manage client accounts, assign landing pages, and view the status of domain connections.
	•	Client Dashboard: Each client will have their own dashboard with a landing page and settings (including domain connection setup).
	•	Landing Page Builder: You can use a drag-and-drop page builder or templates for creating websites/landing pages.
	•	Domain Settings Section: Where the client can input their domain and follow the instructions to point it to your server.
2.	Backend: Convex DB + API:
	•	Convex: Store client data (name, email, domain, etc.), landing page data, and connection status.
	•	API Endpoints: For creating client accounts, managing domains, generating landing pages, etc.
	•	Domain Verification Logic: Verifying if the domain setup is correct (via DNS checks or HTTP requests).
3.	Hosting: Vercel:
	•	Your web app and client landing pages will be hosted on Vercel. Each landing page can be deployed under a unique subdomain or custom domain as requested by the client.
4.	DNS Validation:
	•	You’ll need to validate that the client’s domain is correctly pointing to your server (this could be done via DNS record checks or by hosting a special file on their domain).
